## Discussion

I really liked this program. It was fun and simple to learn the awk scripting
language for it and it seemed like theres lots of excellent resources for learning
awk. The most challenging part of the assignement was just finding the correct 
regexes to ensure the data was properly collected.

Overall I really liked this scripting language and would like to further explore
others in the future.
